      <h1>When to traverse an object graph
        <span class="subtitle thin"></span>
      </h1>

      <p>I&#39;ve been refactoring a .NET app for the past several weeks. It&#39;s my first time really digging into a desktop app, and the architectural similarities with Javascript applications are surprising. Each type of app, being long-lived, requires management of a UI that is typically nested, which in turn raises some interesting questions regarding object responsibility.</p>

<p>One &#39;rule&#39; I&#39;ve found many Javascripters agree on is that child UI elements should never reach into their parents. So, a UserCollectionView object may render a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, and many UserView objects would render their own <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements; but an individual UserView would never reach into the parent collection to, let&#39;s say, check whether another user was currently selected. That&#39;s probably a code smell, pointing to the need for a <code>selectedUser</code> property on the collection.</p>

<p>So, from my time building front ends in both Javascript and .NET, I&#39;ve developed an instinct for not reaching into parent objects. Recently, though, I&#39;ve been working on some back-end code with a fairly complex object graph, and many times I&#39;ve found it appropriate to reach from child objects into their parents. For example, say I have a business contract, and I need to know what the previous contract was, in order to calculate a fee change. To me, it seems completely appropriate to reach into the parent company, look for the latest contract before this one, and get some data from it. A contract should know its own fee change. However, each time I&#39;ve deemed it appropriate, I&#39;ve also had to fight a visceral urge to stop myself.</p>

<p>So, what&#39;s going on here? Even if you disagree with me in this particular case, what are some of the general &#39;rules&#39; that guide this kind of reaching across object relationships? Do the responsibilities for objects in parent-child relationships change so drastically when those objects belong to a GUI, rather than a business domain? What rules apply to <em>all</em> objects in parent-child relationships? Are there rules more specific than looking out for <a href="http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/feature-envy">feature envy</a> in our objects?</p>

<p>I welcome your thoughts.</p>
